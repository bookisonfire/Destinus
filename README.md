Destinus is a story I've had in my head for quite a while now. It started out as an idea for a novel. I found out real quick that I don't have the patience to sit down and write an actual novel. So why not turn the story into a video game? 

My next obstacle, I can't code. So I started teaching myself and taking a few classes online to gain the skills necessary. And that's where I'm at now. I've learned enough to know that I've barely scratched the surface and have so much further to go. 

My goal for this game is to make a riveting story about a boy and his sister surviving the zombie apocalypse in the swamps of Louisiana. Lots of Zombies, bandits, Raiders, Voodoo cultists, and so many more surprises await. There's survival, base building, and guns. What more could you ask for? Oh yeah! A great idea popped into my head to turn this also into a multi-player, extraction type shooter with home town's that you can make your own and show off to your friends.
